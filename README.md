# TranslatingApp
Python app for language translations

This is an app capable of translating from one language to another. The app makes use of the Python module translate, which requires additional instalation (pip).
The program can read from a text file, translate the text in another language, and save the changes to a new file. As it is now, the program translates the file
test.txt from English to Japanese, then saves the translation into the file test-ja.txt. It could be adjusted to translate between another pair of languages.
